# TITLE: Real-time Data Classification API

## DESCRIPTION: 
The goal of this project is to provide a stable and adaptable platform that can analyze and categorize real-time data streams according to rules that the user defines. Utilising state-of-the-art backend technology and web technologies, it guarantees accurate and rapid data processing. Because of this, the platform is perfect for applications that need efficient data handling and real-time decision-making.

## üéØ Purpose
This project's main objective is to offer a real-time, scalable data processing system that allows users to create custom classification rules. This project guarantees that user-defined rules may be applied promptly to incoming data, making the system ideal for a variety of real-world applications. It accomplishes this by integrating JWT for secure authentication, a strong database for rule storage, and real-time data streaming capabilities.


## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Features
Some of the key features of the projects are:

i. JWT Authentication

    ->JWT Authentication Middleware: Middleware has been integrated to handle JWT authentication, ensuring secure access to protected routes.
    ->Token Validation: All incoming requests are validated to ensure they contain a valid JWT token in the header, safeguarding against unauthorized access.
    ->User Signup and Login Endpoints: I have created endpoints for user signup and login, enabling users to securely register and authenticate.

ii. Data Models and Database Integration
    The project includes a comprehensive design and implementation of the database schema, focusing on user-defined rules and associated operations

    -> Schema design for storing user and rule data.
    -> CRUD operations for managing user-defined classification rules.
    -> Integration with a database for persistent storage.

iii. User-Defined Classification Rules

    -> Parser to interpret and validate user-defined rules.
    -> API endpoints for rule management (create, read, update, delete).

iv. Real-time Data Processing    

    -> WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live data streaming.
    -> Real-time classification engine to process data streams using defined rules

## üìß Endpoints

**Create an User**:
  ```bash
  http://{{host}}:{{port}}/signup
  ```
- **Login a user**:
  ```bash
  http://{{host}}:{{port}}/login
  ```
- **Create a Rule**:
  ```bash
  http://{{host}}:{{port}}/addQ   # Adding New Rule
  ````
- **Update a Rule**:
  ```bash
  http://{{host}}:{{port}}/updateQ    # Updating a rule 
  ```
- **Delete a Rule**:
  ```bash
  http://{{host}}:{{port}}/deleteQ    # Deleting a rule
  ```
 **running query by a user**:
  ```bash
  http://{{host}}:{{port}}/run-query 
  ```
